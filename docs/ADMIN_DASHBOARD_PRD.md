- **Chart.js Date Adapter** - For time-series charts
- **Existing EventCall utilities** - Reuse existing functions where possible
- **No additional backend** - All processing client-side from existing JSON files

---

### 4.2 Data Sources & Calculations

#### 4.2.1 Event Data
- **Source:** `/events/*.json` files
- **Parsing:**
  ```javascript
  async function loadAllEvents() {
    const eventFiles = await getEventFileList(); // Via GitHub API
    const events = await Promise.all(
      eventFiles.map(file => fetch(file).then(r => r.json()))
    );
    return events;
  }
  ```
- **Metrics Calculated:**
  - Total events: `events.length`
  - Active events: `events.filter(e => e.status === 'active').length`
  - Events this month: `events.filter(e => isThisMonth(e.created)).length`
  - Growth rate: `((currentMonth - lastMonth) / lastMonth) * 100`

#### 4.2.2 RSVP Data
- **Source:** `/rsvps/*.json` files (array format)
- **Parsing:**
  ```javascript
  async function loadAllRSVPs() {
    const rsvpFiles = await getRSVPFileList();
    const rsvpArrays = await Promise.all(
      rsvpFiles.map(file => fetch(file).then(r => r.json()))
    );
    return rsvpArrays.flat(); // Flatten arrays
  }
  ```
- **Metrics Calculated:**
  - Total RSVPs: `rsvps.length`
  - Attending count: `rsvps.filter(r => r.attending === true).length`
  - Average response rate: `(rsvps.length / events.length) * 100`
  - Total guests: `rsvps.reduce((sum, r) => sum + (r.guestCount || 1), 0)`

#### 4.2.3 User Data

**⚠️ Important Note on User Data Aggregation:**

Browser security models prevent accessing localStorage across different user sessions. The admin dashboard cannot read other users' localStorage data from the browser.

**Recommended Approaches:**

**Option 1: GitHub Actions Aggregation (Recommended)**
- Create a GitHub Actions workflow that aggregates user data from authentication events
- Store aggregated user data in a central `users/users.json` file in the repository
- Admin dashboard fetches this file like events and RSVPs
- Workflow triggers:
  - On user registration (via existing `api-auth.yml`)
  - On user login (update last login timestamp)
  - On user profile update
- **Implementation:**
  ```javascript
  async function loadAllUsers() {
    // Fetch aggregated user data from GitHub
    const response = await fetch('users/users.json');
    const users = await response.json();
    return users;
  }
  ```

**Option 2: Derive from Event Creators (Interim Solution)**
- Extract unique event creators from `events[].createdBy` field
- Build basic user metrics from event data
- Limited information available (no registration dates, last login, etc.)
- **Implementation:**
  ```javascript
  function getUsersFromEvents(events) {
    // Group events by creator in a single pass (O(events) complexity)
    const eventsByCreator = events.reduce((acc, event) => {
      const email = event.createdBy;
      if (!acc[email]) {
        acc[email] = [];
      }
      acc[email].push(event);
      return acc;
    }, {});

    // Build user objects from grouped events
    const users = Object.entries(eventsByCreator).map(([email, userEvents]) => {
      return {
        id: email,
        email: email,
        name: userEvents[0]?.createdByName || extractNameFromEmail(email),
        eventCount: userEvents.length,
        firstEventDate: Math.min(...userEvents.map(e => e.created)),
        lastEventDate: Math.max(...userEvents.map(e => e.created)),
        role: 'manager' // All event creators are managers
      };
    });

    return users;
  }
  ```

**Recommendation for Implementation:**
1. **Phase 1**: Use Option 2 (derive from events) for initial implementation
2. **Phase 2**: Implement Option 1 (GitHub Actions) for complete user management features
3. **Phase 3**: Consider dedicated backend service for real-time user data (future enhancement)

**Required GitHub Actions Workflow:**
```yaml
name: Aggregate User Data
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 * * * *' # Hourly aggregation

jobs:
  aggregate-users:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Aggregate user data
        run: |
          # Collect user registration events from issues/workflows
          # Merge with existing users.json
          # Update last login timestamps
          # Save to users/users.json

      - name: Commit updated users data
        run: |
          git config user.name "github-actions[bot]"
          git config user.email "41898282+github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com"
          git add users/users.json
          git commit -m "Update aggregated user data [skip ci]"
          git push
```

#### 4.2.4 Caching Strategy
- **Cache Duration:** 5 minutes
- **Refresh Triggers:**
  - Manual refresh button click
  - Auto-refresh every 5 minutes (if admin dashboard is active)
  - After admin action (e.g., deleting event)
- **Implementation:**
  ```javascript
  let dataCache = {
    events: null,
    rsvps: null,
    users: null,
    lastUpdated: null
  };

  async function loadDashboardData(forceRefresh = false) {
    const cacheAge = Date.now() - dataCache.lastUpdated;
    if (!forceRefresh && cacheAge < 5 * 60 * 1000) {
      return dataCache; // Use cached data
    }
    // Fetch fresh data
    dataCache.events = await loadAllEvents();
    dataCache.rsvps = await loadAllRSVPs();
    dataCache.users = await getAllUsers();
    dataCache.lastUpdated = Date.now();
    return dataCache;
  }
  ```

---

### 4.3 Security Considerations

#### 4.3.1 Access Control
- **Username Check:**
  ```javascript
  function canAccessAdminDashboard() {
    const currentUser = userAuth.getCurrentUser();
    return currentUser && currentUser.username === 'semperadmin';
  }
  ```
- **Route Protection:**
  - Check on dashboard page load
  - Check before any admin action
  - Redirect unauthorized users immediately

#### 4.3.2 Data Modification Safeguards
- **Confirmation Modals:** For all destructive actions (delete, suspend)

## 9. Risks & Mitigation

### 9.1 Technical Risks

**Risk 1: Large Dataset Performance**
- **Description:** As events/RSVPs grow (1000+ events), dashboard may slow down
- **Likelihood:** Medium
- **Impact:** High
- **Mitigation:**
  - Implement pagination early
  - Use Web Workers for heavy calculations
  - Consider server-side aggregation in future (GitHub Actions workflow)
  - Limit default date range to last 90 days

**Risk 2: Chart.js Integration Issues**
- **Description:** Chart.js may conflict with existing code or have rendering bugs
- **Likelihood:** Low
- **Impact:** Medium
- **Mitigation:**
  - Test Chart.js in isolated environment first
  - Use stable version (4.x)
  - Include fallback to table view if charts fail
  - Properly destroy chart instances to prevent memory leaks

**Risk 3: Data Inconsistency**
- **Description:** JSON files may have inconsistent structure, breaking calculations
- **Likelihood:** Medium
- **Impact:** Medium
- **Mitigation:**
  - Implement robust error handling
  - Validate data structure on load
  - Display error messages for invalid data
  - Provide data cleanup utility

---

### 9.2 UX Risks

**Risk 1: Admin Overwhelmed by Data**
- **Description:** Too many metrics and charts may confuse rather than inform
- **Likelihood:** Medium
- **Impact:** Medium
- **Mitigation:**
  - Start with top-line metrics only
  - Progressive disclosure (expand for details)
  - Provide dashboard tour/tutorial
  - Allow admin to customize dashboard layout (future)

**Risk 2: Mobile Experience Subpar**
- **Description:** Complex dashboard may not work well on mobile
- **Likelihood:** Low (admin likely uses desktop)
- **Impact:** Low
- **Mitigation:**
  - Optimize for tablet/desktop primarily
  - Ensure critical features work on mobile
  - Test on actual mobile devices

---

### 9.3 Security Risks

**Risk 1: Hardcoded Admin Username**
- **Description:** Username `semperadmin` is hardcoded, not flexible for multiple admins
- **Likelihood:** High (by design)
- **Impact:** Low (acceptable for v1)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Document limitation
  - Plan for role-based access in v2
  - Ensure strong password for `semperadmin`

**Risk 2: Client-Side Data Access**
- **Description:** All data visible in browser (JSON files), potential privacy concern
- **Likelihood:** Low (GitHub repo already controls access)
- **Impact:** Medium
- **Mitigation:**
  - Maintain GitHub repo access control
  - Don't expose sensitive data in exports
  - Consider server-side analytics aggregation (future)

---

// Event creation trend line chart
const ctx = document.getElementById('eventTrendChart').getContext('2d');
const eventTrendChart = new Chart(ctx, {
  type: 'line',
  data: {
    labels: ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May', 'Jun'],
    datasets: [{
      label: 'Events Created',
      data: [12, 19, 15, 25, 22, 30],
      borderColor: '#d4af37',
      backgroundColor: 'rgba(212, 175, 55, 0.1)',
      tension: 0.4,
      fill: true
    }]
  },
  options: {
    responsive: true,
    maintainAspectRatio: false,
    plugins: {
      legend: {
        display: true,
        position: 'top'
      },
      tooltip: {
        mode: 'index',
        intersect: false
      }
    },
    scales: {
      y: {
        beginAtZero: true,
        ticks: {
          precision: 0
        }
      }
    }
  }
});
```

### 11.2 Sample Metric Calculations

```javascript
// Calculate average RSVPs per event
function calculateAvgRSVPsPerEvent(events, rsvps) {
  if (events.length === 0) return 0;

  const avgRSVPs = rsvps.length / events.length;
  return Math.round(avgRSVPs * 10) / 10; // Round to 1 decimal place
}

// Calculate true engagement rate (requires inviteeCount tracking)
// Note: This requires adding an 'inviteeCount' field to each event object
// Uses weighted average: (total RSVPs / total invitees) for statistical accuracy
function calculateEngagementRate(events, rsvps) {
  // Filter events that have invitee count tracking
  const eventsWithInviteeData = events.filter(event => event.inviteeCount && event.inviteeCount > 0);

  if (eventsWithInviteeData.length === 0) {
    // Fallback: return average RSVPs per event if invitee tracking not available
    return calculateAvgRSVPsPerEvent(events, rsvps);
  }

  // Group RSVPs by event
  const rsvpsByEvent = groupRSVPsByEvent(rsvps);

  // Calculate weighted engagement rate (total RSVPs / total invitees)
  let totalRSVPsWithInviteeCount = 0;
  let totalInvitees = 0;

  eventsWithInviteeData.forEach(event => {
    totalRSVPsWithInviteeCount += rsvpsByEvent[event.id]?.length || 0;
    totalInvitees += event.inviteeCount;
  });

  if (totalInvitees === 0) {
    return 0; // Avoid division by zero
  }

  // Return true weighted engagement rate
  const trueEngagementRate = (totalRSVPsWithInviteeCount / totalInvitees) * 100;
  return Math.round(trueEngagementRate);
}

// Calculate growth rate
function calculateGrowthRate(currentPeriod, previousPeriod) {
  if (previousPeriod === 0) return 100;

  const growth = ((currentPeriod - previousPeriod) / previousPeriod) * 100;
  return Math.round(growth);
}

// Get events by date range
function filterEventsByDateRange(events, startDate, endDate) {
  return events.filter(event => {
    const eventDate = new Date(event.created);
    return eventDate >= startDate && eventDate <= endDate;
  });
}

// Group RSVPs by event
function groupRSVPsByEvent(rsvps) {
  return rsvps.reduce((acc, rsvp) => {
    if (!acc[rsvp.eventId]) {
      acc[rsvp.eventId] = [];
    }
    acc[rsvp.eventId].push(rsvp);
    return acc;
  }, {});
}
```

### 11.3 Glossary

- **KPI:** Key Performance Indicator - measurable value showing how effectively objectives are achieved
- **RSVP:** Répondez s'il vous plaît - response to event invitation
- **Engagement Rate:** Percentage of invited guests who respond to an event (requires invitee count tracking); if not tracked, displayed as "Average RSVPs per Event" instead
- **Average RSVPs per Event:** Total RSVPs divided by total events (used when invitee count is not tracked)
- **Check-in Rate:** Percentage of attendees who check in at event
- **Response Time:** Time from event creation to first RSVP
- **Active User:** User who has logged in or created event in last 30 days
- **Event Success:** Event with RSVP rate > 50% and high attendance

This PRD requires approval from:

- [ ] **Product Owner:** _______________________ Date: _______
- [ ] **Technical Lead:** _______________________ Date: _______
- [ ] **Admin User (semperadmin):** _____________ Date: _______

**Version History:**
- v1.0 - November 4, 2025 - Initial draft
- v1.1 - November 5, 2025 - Technical corrections:
  - Fixed user data aggregation strategy (removed localStorage approach, added GitHub Actions workflow)
  - Corrected engagement rate calculation to use invitee count or display as "Average RSVPs per Event"
  - Updated data flow documentation
  - Added implementation recommendations for phased rollout
- v1.2 - November 5, 2025 - Performance and accuracy improvements:
  - **Performance**: Optimized `getUsersFromEvents()` from O(creators × events) to O(events) complexity
  - **Accuracy**: Changed engagement rate to use weighted average (total RSVPs / total invitees) instead of average of percentages
  - **CI Safety**: Added `[skip ci]` to GitHub Actions commit to prevent infinite workflow loops
  - **Best Practice**: Updated to use official github-actions[bot] email address in workflow
